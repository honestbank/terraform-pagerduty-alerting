# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# Sorry everyone, this repository and incident-management have seen too much breakage over the past few months.
# Until both PR reviewers and authors become more conscientious all code changes will require my review/approval.
